The Cardinal **Delete Access Points** tile is where an user can delete
an existing AP from Cardinal.

All this feature does is delete the AP from the Cardinal database. After
deletion, the AP will still have the configurations from before. If you
wish to delete an AP and also wipe the configuration, I would recommend
first running **Flash AP** from **Configure Access Points** and then
delete the AP from Cardinal.
