The \ **Delete 5GHz  SSID from Cardinal** tile allows an user to delete
an existing 5GHz SSID from Cardinal’s database, \ **NOT** the AP. If you
wish to delete the SSID from the AP, please use the \ **Delete
SSID** tiles.

This will delete the SSID from Cardinal, completely. If you are going to
wipe the SSID out completely, I would recommend first deleting the SSIDs
from the AP’s. Then, I would delete the SSID from Cardinal. Currently,
there is no way to see which AP’s have a certain SSID associated to it.
I am working on that feature.
