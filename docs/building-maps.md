The **Cardinal Building Maps** tile is an attempt to be comparable with
Cisco WCS. The Building Maps tile is where you can view building layouts
and see heatmap coverage of access points.

**IMPORTANT: This feature is still in-development! The accuracy of
access point coverage is based on prediction!Â **

When you click on the map icon, a modal will appear. The modal will
display all of the current maps stored. When you click on a map, you
should see your corresponding map appear, for example:
