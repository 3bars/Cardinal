The Cardinal **TFTP Backup** tile is where an user can backup an access
point's configuration via TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol). The
user simply enters the IP address of the TFTP server, as well as a name
for the backup. Then, Cardinal will open a connection to the access
point, and backup the configuration per the user's input.

**TFTP IP** - The IP address of the TFTP server the configuration will
be backed up to. Cardinal has a built-in TFTP server (if the tftpd-hpa
package is installed).

**Config Backup Name** - The name of the access point configuration
file.
