The **Add New Heatmap** tile is where you can create a building heatmap
from a previously uploaded building/location image. When you click on
the map icon, a modal will appear. The modal will look like this:

**Location Name** - This is where you type in the name of the heatmap
page. When you create a heatmap, a PHP page is generated in the
***\$cardinal\_base/assets/building\_maps*** directory. The image is
inserted into the page with an added heatmap layer (compliments of
[*heatmap.js*](https://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/)).

**Choose Heatmap Image** - This is where you can select the image you
uploaded for the heatmap page. For example:

Once you submit the page for creation, you can navigate your building
heatmaps by visiting the **Building Maps** tile.
