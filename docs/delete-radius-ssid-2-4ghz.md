The Cardinal **Delete RADIUS SSID (2.4GHz)** tile is where an user can
delete an existing 2.4GHz 802.1x SSID from a Cardinal managed AP.

This will send a series of SSH commands that will delete the SSID
configurations from AP. If you wish to perform this action, on a wider
scale, please use the **Delete RADIUS SSID (2.4GHz) (Group)**
tile. Please make sure you create an access point group before utilizing
this feature.
