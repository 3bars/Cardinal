The **Cardinal Network Toolkit** is where a user can run useful network
diagnostic commands. The commands you can run from the toolkit include
Nmap, Ping, Traceroute, Dig, Whois Lookup, and cURL.

When you click on the toolkit icon, a modal should pop up. This is what
should appear:

**Nmap Scan** - The Nmap functionality requires installing Nmap on your
system. The Nmap command that runs includes -v (increases verbosity
level) and -A (enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning,
and traceroute).

***IMPORTANT: Nmap is a dangerous tool! Please use Nmap with the utmost
care and remember, with great power comes great responsibility.Â ***

**Ping** - Runs a ICMP test against an IP address/hostname.

**Traceroute** - Runs a traceroute against an IP address/hostname.

**Dig** - Runs dig against an IP address/hostname. Dig is a flexible
tool for interrogating DNS name servers.

**Whois Lookup** - Runs a DNS Whois lookup on an IP address/website.

**Curl** - Runs cURL against an IP address/website. The only switch used
for cURL is -I (shows document info only).
