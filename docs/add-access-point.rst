The **Cardinal Add Access Point** tile is where an user can add a Cisco
SSH-ready AP. When clicking on the plus sign, a modal window pops up.
Here is what should pop up:

|image1|

**Access Point Name** - This is the name of the access point. The name
could be an office, building, etc.

**Access Point IP Address** - In order to use Cardinal, the access
points must have static IP addresses and have SSH enabled. This is where
you would populate the IP address for the access point.

**Access Point Group** - In Cardinal, you can add multiple access points
into a group. The benefit of using the access point group feature is
that you can add several AP's to a group, and then execute commands to
all of the access points in the group.

**SSH Username** - This is the SSH username for accessing the access
point.

**SSH Password** - This is the SSH password for accessing the access
point.

**SNMP Community** - In Cardinal, you can use the SNMP functionality
already on the Cisco access point for features such as rebooting,
collecting access point information, etc.
