<h1>Cardinal</h1>

Cardinal is an open source Cisco access point controller. Cardinal is built on Python and uses `paramiko` to handle the configuration of access points via SSH. In order to use Cardinal, your Cisco AP's must be in autonomous mode (K9W7 IOS) and have SSH enabled.

<h2>Why Cardinal?</h2>
People say that Cardinals represent loved ones who have passed. When Cardinals visit you, they carry love and remembrance. When I developed Cardinal, I thought of one person, in particular, who loved the red bird. I once knew a woman in a nursing home who loved Cardinals. She was exceptionally benevolent and always happy. Unfortunately, she passed away in 2013.
In her memory, I decided to name the project Cardinal. I intend to post more about my road to developing Cardinal. Cardinal is still in-development to this day. Cardinal definitely needs work! As I build Cardinal, I learn more about programming and application development. I hope that one day Cardinal becomes an open source alternative to the Cisco WLC.<br>
